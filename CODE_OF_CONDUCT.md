# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be helpful. Be respectful. Focus on the code.

## The Longer Version

**Do:**
- Give constructive feedback on technical merit
- Assume good faith
- Help newcomers learn
- Admit when you're wrong

**Don't:**
- Attack people (attack ideas instead)
- Derail discussions with off-topic drama
- Be a jerk

## Enforcement

This project has a BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life). The maintainer's decision is final.

Persistent bad actors get banned. No committee, no appeals process, no drama.

## Scope

This applies to project spaces: issues, PRs, discussions. What you do elsewhere is your business.

## That's It

We're here to build good software. Everything else is noise.
